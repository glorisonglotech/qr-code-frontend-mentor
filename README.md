### What I Learned

This project helped me practice creating a responsive layout using CSS and Flexbox. I also learned how to use media queries to adjust the design for smaller screens.

Hereâ€™s an example of a media query I used:

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {
  .container {
    padding: 15px 10px;
    width: 90%;
  }
}
```
